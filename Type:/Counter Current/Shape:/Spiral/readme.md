The best shape for a Counter-Current Heat Exchanger:
# Spiral Cylinder, or Helix
like a electrical Solenoid or DNA helix have two tubes wound around a center axis, and surrounded by insulation. Has the highest Length To Surface Area

# Pancake, Bifilar Coil
Very similar to Tesla's Bifilar Coil, have the spiral wound in a flat disk! This is very efficent but has slightly lower Length To Surface Area than the Cylinder
